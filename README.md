## Abstract of Article:

> Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned to be an essential component of the paradigm for beyond 5G networks as it can potentially provide similar or higher  array gains with much lower hardware cost and energy consumption compared with the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. In this paper, we focus on one of the fundamental challenges, namely the channel acquisition, in a RIS-assisted multiuser MIMO system. The state-of-the-art channel acquisition approach in such a system with fully passive RIS elements estimates the cascaded transmitter-to-RIS and RIS-to-receiver channels by adopting excessively long training sequences. To estimate the cascaded channels with an affordable training overhead, we formulate the channel estimation problem in the RIS-assisted multiuser MIMO system as a matrix-calibration based matrix factorization task.  By exploiting the information on the slow-varying channel components and the hidden channel sparsity, we propose a novel message-passing based algorithm to factorize the cascaded channels.  Furthermore, we present an analytical framework to characterize the theoretical performance bound of the proposed estimator in the large-system limit. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
